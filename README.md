PAL Language Tests
==================

Collaborative test suite for the `CMP409` PAL compiler coursework.

## Structure

* `valid/` contains programs that should compiler without any errors.
* `syntax/` contains programs that should generate syntax errors.
* `semantic/` contains programs that should generate semantics errors.
* `bad/` contains programs that should generate both syntax and semantics errors.

compilers better. Everyone is encouraged to contribute new files or report bug.
